# Codebook
Tags: General Skills, shell, Python  
Author: LT 'syreal' Jones
## Description
Run the Python script `code.py` in the same directory as `codebook.txt`.
* [Download code.py](./code.py)
* [Download codebook.txt](./codebook.txt)
## Hints
1. On the webshell, use `ls` to see if both files are in the directory you are in
1. The `str_xor` function does not need to be reverse engineered for this challenge.
## Approach
Same directory means same folder in the computer. Just make sure to download them into the same folder. After downloading, navigate to the folder with terminal (so `cd` and your path, eg. `cd Documents/Codebook`) then run the file with either `python code.py` or `python3 code.py` depending on what version of Python you have installed.
